"""
Problem Statement :
 *  
 * Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
 * What if you cannot use any additional data structure?
 * 
 * ASCII v/s UNICODE - String can be either of these. ASCII has basically 128
 * characters (256 in a extended set) ranging from 0 - 127 whereas, UNICODE is
 * a superset of ASCII and has 0 - 2^21 characters. Only difference is size.
