-- # Write your MySQL query statement below
-- # 1. Calculate the difference of log_id and the rank
-- # 2. Group by the difference between log_id and num and set the min value as start_id and max value as end_id

SELECT min(log_id) as start_id, 
       max(log_id) as end_id
FROM (SELECT log_id, 
             RANK() OVER(ORDER BY log_id) as num
      FROM Logs) a
GROUP BY log_id - num
